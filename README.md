## 🛠 Projects

### 🧠 Face Emotion and Identity Recognition
Developed a facial recognition system using **OpenCV** and **deep learning models** that could detect both identity and emotional state. Used CNN-based emotion classifiers trained on public datasets.

### 🧩 Object Recognition & Image Classification
Built an object classification pipeline using **TensorFlow/Keras**, applied to real-world objects using live camera input. Improved accuracy through data augmentation and transfer learning.

### 🚦 Traffic Signal Detection using AI
Created a traffic signal detection system for smart mobility using color thresholding + CNN. Useful for autonomous vehicles to interpret traffic light states in real-time.

### 📱 Smart Waste Management Website
Developed a full-stack solution for waste management with team — including sensor integration, Firebase backend, and a responsive dashboard to display bin status and optimize pickup.

### 🧭 AR-Based Indoor Navigation (NIT Manipur)
Built a **3D AR navigation system** using **Unity and ARCore**. Integrated with **QR codes** and **Firebase** to provide indoor positioning and pathfinding for campus buildings.

### 🔁 Distributed Optimization (Step-size Adaptive Learning)
Implemented multiple distributed optimization algorithms like DSGD, DADAM, and your own **Row-Stochastic + Correction** method using **PyTorch**. Focused on dynamic step-size tracking, consensus error, and communication-efficiency.

### 🔐 Secure Swarm Robotics Protocol
Worked on swarm-level coordination algorithms with embedded **encryption and authentication layers**. Focus on decentralized message passing using ESP32s and LoRa modules.

### 🛰 CubeSat Control System (Research)
Exploring CubeSat hardware communication design. Working on **low-power protocols**, **antenna control**, and **modular embedded coding practices** for small satellite systems.

### 🔢 Binary Counter & Blinker using Arduino
Created a binary counter using LED circuits and Arduino timers. Expanded the project to include binary blinker animations for visual signal demonstration.

### ⌨️ 4-bit Binary Adder/Subtractor with Digital ICs
Designed and wired a **4-bit arithmetic unit** using logic gates and 74-series ICs. Verified output using LEDs to visualize bit-level operations.

### 🌪 Sand Simulator with LED Matrix
Programmed a **particle simulation** on an LED matrix to mimic granular flow, controlled by Arduino. Simulated sand-like falling behavior through matrix indexing and LED refresh control.
