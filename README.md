# Hey there, I’m Kotapati Kishore! 👋

I'm an Electrical Engineering undergrad at *NIT Manipur* who's really into building cool stuff that actually works — from smart embedded systems to simulations that bring numbers to life.

Right now, I’m diving deep into:
- ⚡ Control systems & real-time estimation  
- 🌡 Thermofluid + energy systems modeling  
- 🤖 Embedded + IoT (ESP32 + Firebase = magic)  
- 🧠 Signal processing, system modeling, and a bit of optimization chaos

---

## 🛠 What I Use to Build Stuff
- *Languages:* Python, C, MATLAB (yes, I enjoy it), HTML/CSS  
- *Tools:* Simulink, KiCAD, LTSpice, Firebase, Arduino IDE  
- *Skills:* Data-driven control, cloud + hardware integration, building systems from scratch

## 🧪 Projects I'm Proud Of
*Smart Agri-Waste System*  
> Built with ESP32, gas + ultrasonic sensors, Firebase, and some wild debugging. Tracks waste levels in real-time and pings alerts like a boss.

*System Simulations*  
> Modeled dynamic systems and PID loops in MATLAB/Simulink.  
> If it moves, I probably tried to control it (virtually).

## 🎓 Education
*B.Tech in Electrical Engineering*  
National Institute of Technology Manipur (2023–present{2027})

## 🔍 Currently Looking For
- Internships in control/estimation/embedded systems  
- Research gigs in energy systems, thermodynamics, or cool hardware  
- Teams who love building what doesn’t exist yet
